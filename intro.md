# Introduction

**Jupyter notebooks, Python and Pandas**  are some of the most used tools in data science
* DataFrames are very similar to a spreadsheet
* Add and delete columns and rows
* Create and display charts and maps
* Much more!

In this workshop we will use them to analyse **UK crime data**
* open data from https://data.police.uk/data/ 
* available for all of UK 
* locations, time and date of all crimes recorded
* pre-processed for London in this [notebook](https://github.com/IBMDeveloperUK/crime-data-workshop/blob/master/notebooks/prepare-uk-crime-data.ipynb)
  * monthly csv files for each police district 
  * extracted one year of data for London into 3 files
  * cleaned up data - only selected a few variables
  
**Geospatial data**
* Location
* Points, lines and polygons
* Extra functionality to find distances between points, select data inside a polygon, etc

**Jupyter notebooks**
* Follow the instructions to set up a notebook using
